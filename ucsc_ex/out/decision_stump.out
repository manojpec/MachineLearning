1. Stump algorithm:
Impurity Improvement \Delta Δ: 0.09490923990488173
Optimal Threshold \tau τ: 68.0 

2. Linear classifier:
Pseudoinverse method: w0: -9.90505892  w1: 0.14566241

3.
For the given 1D feature Height X, from the weights calculated via pseudoinverse method, the linear classification separating line equation can be solved to get the separating height.
                    w0 + w1x = 0
-9.90505892 + 0.14566241 * x = 0
                           x = 9.90505892 / 0.14566241
                           x = 68.00010325

The separating height thus calculated via linear classifier matches almost exactly with the optimal threshold \tau τ = 68.0 calculated via stump algorithm.
